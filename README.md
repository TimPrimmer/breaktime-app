# Parktime
## Project 2: UT Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp
### Developers: Tim Primmer, Erin Holmes, & Derek Beckford

## Purpose
Our goal while creating Parktime 1.0 was to help users find National Parks near them with the option to select activities they'd like the park to have. While Parktime 1.0 was great, it was missing some elements that could provide an even better user experience. 

Parktime 2.0 is a completely revamped website, with all the same functionality of Parktime 1.0 and more! We took our single-page front-end app and converted it to a full-stack web application using the MVC paradigm. Parktime now connects to a server via Express, utilizes a sql database, the ORM sequelize, handlebars templeting engine, has user authentication, pagination, and allows users to leave comments on parks!

# User Stories
* As a user, I want to find parks near a location, with certain activities, so that I can find the best park for me.
* As a user, I want to create an account, so that I can save my favorite parks and access the next time I login.
* As a user, I want to leave a comment on a single park, that other users can see.


# Breakdown of tasks
Our team was very collaborative throughout the whole project. We made sure to discuss complex-code before submitting PRs and worked together to merge complex files. We each made sure to touch every part of the project, ex: adding front-end js, creating views in handlebars, creating sequelize models, setting up server and api routes, and front-end styling.

# Challenges
Converting Parktime 1.0 to the MVC paradigm, converting a single-page app using Handlebars, sorting by categories, & adding comment functionality. 

# Successes
We collaborated well as a group, overcame the many challenges, merged very complicated files together, and learned a lot about full-stack web development throughout the process.
