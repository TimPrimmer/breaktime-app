# Parktime
## Project 1: UT Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp
### Developers: Tim Primmer & Erin Holmes

What is Parktime?
- Parktime is a responsive, single-page application that helps users find National Parks near by. Users enter a starting address and choose which activities theyâ€™d like the park to have, and Parktime will show parks near the user that match the activity criteria. Users can also save their favorite parks to view any time!

User Story: 
- As a user, I want to find parks near a location, with certain activities, so that I can find the best park for me.

Technologies Used: 
- Javascript, HTML, Custom CSS, Jquery, Geoapify, Iconic, National Park API, Google Maps API, OpenWeather API

Team Breakdown of Tasks: 
- Our team was very collaborative throughout the whole project. We communicated frequently to ensure we each had a part in creating the website (HTML,CSS,JS) while not interfering with each others work. We also enforced pull request reviews, and discussed complex-code thoroughly before pushing major changes.

Challenges
- The saving system, formatting and displaying the park API data, filtering by category, keeping it a single-page app

Successes
- Working website, styling and presentation, overcoming the challenges, mobile responsive
