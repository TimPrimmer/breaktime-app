# Breakdown of tasks and roles
Our team was very collaborative throughout the whole project. We communicated frequently to ensure we each had a part in creating the website (HTML,CSS,JS) while not interfering with each others work. We also enforced pull request reviews, and discussed complex-code thoroughly before pushing major changes.

# Challenges
The saving system, formatting and displaying the park API data, filtering by category, keeping it a single-page app

# Successes
Working website, styling and presentation, overcoming the challenges
